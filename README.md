# ANILOG Editor

This is a web-based editor for an app project. To use this you will need to install local web server software and use a command line.

If you are familiar setting up and running web apps using a console, this should be easy. If you are a casual user, this could be hard.

There is no support. Use at your own risk! :)

# Usage

2. Install Yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install 
3. Install dependencies: run `yarn install`
4. Launch the web app: `yarn start`
